## Workshop Description

_from [conference.mcn.edu/2016](https://conference.mcn.edu/2016/profile.cfm?profile_name=session&master_key=880FF14A-FDC1-2E77-BC15-F05A7082788F&page_key=AD2CAECE-E55C-4B47-9116-F9CB5C96B5DD&xtemplate&userLGNKEY=0)_

Arduino! Raspberry Pi! It's very likely that you've heard of these open source 
microcontrollers and minicomputers. You might even own them. Unfortunately, 
there’s a huge gulf between beginner “blink an LED” tutorials and advanced 
projects, with few useful things in between. 

Our goal in this workshop is to introduce you to open source hardware (OSHW), 
and get you started by building two basic-but-practical projects you can use 
in your museum (a video player and an infrared visitor counter). We’ll let 
you choose one of them to expand upon with advanced lessons, and then discuss 
ways you can move beyond them to other projects with your newfound knowledge. 

Participants should bring a laptop computer, and will be given software to 
install before the workshop. Hardware and tools will be provided for the 
duration of the workshop, and participants will be able to purchase a kit 
to take back with them to their museums. All code for the projects will be 
made available to participants.
