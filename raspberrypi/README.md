# MCN 2016 Workshop - Raspberry Pi Video Player

## Introduction

## What is a Raspberry Pi? 

## Installing
### Part 1 - Formatting and first boot
(We already did this part for you, but you should still install the software.)
* Install the [official SDFormatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/) on your laptop computer.
* Reformat the SD card. [Here's how.](http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2015/03/how-to-format-pi-sd-cards-using-sd-formatter/) Give it a name that's easy to recognize, like `RASPBERRY`.
* Install [PiBakery](http://pibakery.org/download.html) on your laptop computer. PiBakery includes a version of the Raspbian operating system for your Pi, so it's a rather large download (~2GB). 
* Download the recipe for our SD card [here](./mcn2016recipe.xml).
* Import it into PiBakery. Edit the name of the Pi. Edit your WiFi details! 
* Make sure your SD card is in, and click the `Write` icon! This will take about 10 minutes.
* When it's done, eject the card and insert it into your Pi, and plug in the power. This part will take 10-15 minutes.
